The system contains a fall detection system with a GSM instant feature that can send calls to caretakers for emergency services. It also involves the balance monitoring system that rings the alarm when the body is not balanced. The concept and implementation comprises both hardware and software, which detect and notify fall seamlessly and monitor a body balance. This project involves Proteus software to design the system, Arduino for programming and MATLAB software for the GUI system. The main objective of this project is to innovate new technology involving body balancing and fall detection devices that can monitor and protect the elderly.
